# üñºÔ∏è Wllp

A very simple python script made to change the gnome desktop wallpaper periodically.

You can configure the settings by using --help:

     usage: background.py [-h] [--path PATH] [--darkmode DARKMODE]

     Thanks for using wllp :D, help:

     options:
       -h, --help           show this help message and exit
       --path PATH          Select which path to use
       --darkmode DARKMODE  Choose true, false or both based on your system theme

--path, the path to the folder containing your wallpapers; ex - /home/user/Pictures/MyAwesomeWallpapers <br>
--darkmode, true, false or 'both' based on which theme you are using, light or dark.
